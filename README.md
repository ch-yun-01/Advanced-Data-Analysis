# Advanced-Data-Analysis
Projects from the Advanced Data Analysis course

In this project, we explore **EEGNet** implementations in **PyTorch** for **ADHD classification** based on EEG signals.

Two versions are included:
- **EEGNet.ipynb**: Baseline EEGNet implementation
- **EEGNet_ICA.ipynb**: EEGNet with **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** preprocessing for noise/artifact removal

- **Dataset**: [EEG Dataset for ADHD (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danizo/eeg-dataset-for-adhd)
